# multiSampleCaller
Calls somatic SNVs, indels, and allelic copy number jointly across multiple samples from the same patient.  These can be standard tumor/normal pair, longitudinal samples, primary/met, etc.  Can also be used for tumor only calling, ideally with a high tumor content and a low tumor content sample.
